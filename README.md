Crypto-Portfolio
A project using TKinter's GUI to show a range of assets in ones cryptocurrency portfolio, connecting to CoinMarketCap's API.

The GUI has built in buttons to refresh prices, create a pie graph of the worth of assets in a portfolio, export todays data to Excel. Another button can turn price alerts on, where the app will monitor prices every minute and the OS will sound when a coin has hit a certain price.

The portfolio assets/amounts and price alerts are configureable by the user.
